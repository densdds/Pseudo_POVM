# Pseudo_POVM
Quantum computation in terms of pseudo POVMs

pseudo_povm_circuits.py has description of two classes: QubitCircuit and PseudoPovm.

It also has some functions which are used in methods of these classes

pseudo_povm_optimization_test.ipynb contains optimization function which finds basis
of pseudo POVMs in which negatinity of quantum circuit is minimal and also contains test of this function.
